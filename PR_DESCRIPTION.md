# Fix Speech-to-Text Integration with Firebase Extension

## Description
This PR addresses the speech-to-text integration issues that were encountered during Sprint 0 validation. The main issue was a mismatch between how our code expected the Firebase Extension to work and how it actually stores and processes data.

## Changes
- Added a new enhanced Speech-to-Text component that is much more robust
- Implemented collection auto-detection to find where data is being stored
- Added support for multiple field name patterns
- Used collection group queries to find transcription results regardless of location
- Added detailed debug logging throughout the process
- Created fallback mechanisms if primary approaches fail
- Updated the App.tsx file to integrate the new component
- Added documentation about the fixes in FIXES_APPLIED.md

## Testing
- Tested manually with different audio samples
- Component implements multiple approaches to handle different extension configurations
- Debug logs help identify and fix additional issues

## Screenshots
(Add screenshots from testing)

## Additional Notes
The new enhanced component should be used for all future development as it's more robust and provides better debugging capabilities.

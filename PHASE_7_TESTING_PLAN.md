- Provide guided test scenarios
- Collect structured feedback

**Key Areas**:
- Overall usability
- Feature discoverability
- Value perception
- Retention factors

## Test Environments

### Development Environment
- Used for unit tests and initial integration testing
- Local Docker containers for services
- Firebase emulator suite

### Staging Environment
- Production-like environment for system testing
- Isolated Firebase project with test data
- Simulates production configuration

### Production-Like Environment
- Final testing before release
- Uses production configuration with separate data
- Full monitoring and logging

## Test Schedule

| Week | Focus | Key Activities |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Setup & Planning | Finalize test plan, prepare environments, create test data |
| 2 | Unit & Integration | Execute unit tests, fix issues, expand test coverage |
| 3 | End-to-End & Performance | Run E2E scripts, performance benchmarking, fix issues |
| 4 | User Testing & Security | Conduct UAT, security review, final fixes |

## Launch Criteria

Before proceeding to launch, the application must meet the following criteria:

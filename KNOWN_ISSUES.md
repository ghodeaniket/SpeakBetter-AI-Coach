## Overview

This document tracks known issues in the SpeakBetter AI Coach application as of the completion of Phase 6. These issues have been identified during development and testing but were determined to be acceptable for the initial release or scheduled for resolution in future updates.

## Critical Issues

*None currently identified*

## High Priority Issues

### Speech Analysis

| ID | Issue | Description | Workaround | Target Fix |
|----|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| SA-001 | Speech recognition accuracy varies with accents | Users with certain accents may experience lower transcription accuracy, especially for non-native English speakers | Users can speak more slowly and deliberately; application still provides value through pace metrics and pause detection | v1.1 |
| SA-002 | Analysis timeouts on very long recordings | Recordings over 3 minutes may occasionally timeout during analysis on slower networks | Keep practice sessions under 3 minutes; UI enforces this limit but technical workarounds exist | v1.1 |

### Mobile Application

| ID | Issue | Description | Workaround | Target Fix |
|----|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| MA-001 | Intermittent audio permission issues on iOS | Some iOS devices require app restart after first audio permission grant | Restart app after initial permission grant if recording doesn't start | v1.0.1 |
| MA-002 | Battery usage higher than optimal during recording | Audio recording and processing consumes more battery than desired, especially on older devices | Connect to power source during longer practice sessions | v1.1 |

## Medium Priority Issues

### User Experience

| ID | Issue | Description | Workaround | Target Fix |
|----|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| UX-001 | Progress graphs don't show sufficient detail for power users | Users who practice frequently would benefit from more detailed historical data | Use the session history view to see individual session details | v1.2 |
| UX-002 | Limited customization of feedback style | Users cannot currently adjust the style or detail level of feedback | No workaround available | v1.2 |

### Offline Functionality

| ID | Issue | Description | Workaround | Target Fix |
|----|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| OF-001 | Synchronization conflicts on multiple devices | When using multiple devices offline, synchronization may result in duplicated sessions | Use primary device when offline | v1.1 |
| OF-002 | Limited offline practice modes | Only freestyle practice is available offline | Record offline, analysis will complete when online | v1.2 |

### Cross-Platform

| ID | Issue | Description | Workaround | Target Fix |
|----|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| CP-001 | Subtle UI differences between platforms | Some UI elements have slightly different appearances or behaviors | None needed - functional differences are minimal | Not planned |
| CP-002 | Push notifications only on mobile | Web application does not support push notifications | Use mobile app for practice reminders | v1.3 |

## Low Priority Issues

### Performance

| ID | Issue | Description | Workaround | Target Fix |
|----|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| PF-001 | First-time loading performance | Initial app load time may be longer than subsequent loads due to caching | None needed - one-time issue on first load | v1.2 |
| PF-002 | Animation performance on older devices | UI animations may not be as smooth on older devices | Disable animations in settings (mobile only) | v1.1 |

### Content

| ID | Issue | Description | Workaround | Target Fix |
|----|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| CT-001 | Limited guided reading content | Current selection of guided reading materials is small | Use freestyle mode with own content | v1.2 |
| CT-002 | Q&A practice questions could be more diverse | Current question set has limited industry coverage | Use freestyle mode for specialized topics | v1.2 |

## Known Browser/Device-Specific Issues

| Safari < 15.0 | Audio visualization may be less smooth | Use Chrome or Firefox |

### Mobile Application

| Device/OS | Issue | Workaround |
|-----------|-------|------------|

# SpeakBetter AI Coach: Architecture Analysis

## Current Architecture

The SpeakBetter AI Coach project is currently structured as a monorepo with the following packages:

### Core Packages
- **@speakbetter/core**: Contains shared business logic, models, services, utilities, and validation.
- **@speakbetter/api**: Provides API integrations including Firebase, Google Cloud Speech, and storage services.
- **@speakbetter/ui**: Contains shared UI components, hooks, and theming.
- **@speakbetter/web**: Web application implementation.
- **@speakbetter/mobile**: Mobile application implementation (React Native).

### App Structure
- Empty `apps/web-app` and `apps/mobile-app` directories exist but are not currently used.

### Build System
- Uses Turborepo for build orchestration.
- Each package defines its own build process.
- Core packages use `tsup` for TypeScript compilation.
- Web package uses Vite.
- Mobile package uses React Native CLI.

### Package Dependencies
- Proper workspace dependencies are established.
- Packages correctly reference each other using workspace syntax.

## Current Build Process

### Root Package Scripts
- `dev`: Run development servers across packages
- `build`: Build all packages
- `lint`: Lint all packages
- `clean`: Clean all packages
- `test`: Test all packages

### Package-specific Build Scripts
- **core**: Uses `tsup` for building
- **api**: Currently a placeholder script
- **ui**: Uses `tsup` for building
- **web**: Currently a placeholder script
- **mobile**: Currently a placeholder script with React Native build for mobile

## State Management Approach

There is currently no dedicated state management package. The implementation plan recommends creating a `@speakbetter/state` package using Zustand for cross-platform state management.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Create the state management package
2. Enhance the API package with service adapters
3. Create proper entry points in the `apps/` directory
4. Update build configurations to support the new structure

## Templates Created

To streamline development, the following templates have been created:

### Package Template
- Basic package.json with common dependencies
- TypeScript configuration
- README template

### Service Template
- Service interface definition
- Service implementation factory
- Test file template

### Component Template
- React component template
- Component test file template

### State Management Template
- Zustand store template with immer middleware
- Store test file template

These templates will be used in subsequent phases of the implementation plan to create consistent package structures.

# Fix Text-to-Speech Integration with Firebase Extension

## Description
This PR addresses the text-to-speech integration issues encountered during Sprint 0 validation. The main problem was a mismatch between how our code expected the Firebase Extension to work and how it actually processes and stores data.

## Changes
- Added a new enhanced Text-to-Speech component that is much more robust
- Implemented collection auto-detection to find where data is being stored
- Added support for multiple field name patterns
- Added detailed debug logging throughout the process
- Created multiple storage path handling strategies
- Added comprehensive document creation with multiple field formats
- Updated the App.tsx file to integrate the new component
- Added detailed documentation about the fixes in TTS_FIXES_APPLIED.md

## Problems Solved
1. **Collection Path Mismatch**: The code was hardcoded to use 'tts_requests', but Firebase Extension might use a different collection name
2. **Field Name Discrepancies**: Different extension versions use different field names for status and audio content
3. **Storage Path Handling**: Improved logic to handle various storage path formats
4. **Limited Response Format Support**: Enhanced to handle different response structures
5. **Insufficient Error Handling**: Added detailed debugging capabilities

## Testing
- The fixed component automatically detects the collection being used by the extension
- It tries multiple field name patterns to extract the audio content
- It attempts multiple storage path formats to retrieve the audio file
- Debug logs provide detailed information about each step in the process
- The UI clearly shows which collection is being used

## Additional Notes
The new enhanced component should be used for all future development as it's more robust and provides better debugging capabilities. The detailed documentation in TTS_FIXES_APPLIED.md explains the technical details of the fixes implemented.

# SpeakBetter AI Coach: Build Process Analysis

## Current Build Configuration

### Turborepo Configuration

The project uses Turborepo to orchestrate builds across packages. The `turbo.json` file defines the following pipeline:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "globalDependencies": ["**/.env.*local"],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**", "build/**"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "outputs": []
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    },
    "clean": {
      "cache": false
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "outputs": [],
      "inputs": ["src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.tsx"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Package-specific Build Configurations

#### Core Package
- Uses `tsup` for TypeScript compilation
- Outputs CommonJS and ESM modules
- Generates TypeScript declaration files

#### API Package
- Current build script is a placeholder
- Will need proper implementation in next phase

#### UI Package
- Uses `tsup` for TypeScript compilation
- Has peer dependencies on React and React Native

#### Web Package
- Current build script is a placeholder
- Uses Vite for development

#### Mobile Package
- Uses React Native CLI for iOS and Android builds
- Has additional configuration for web support using webpack

## Build Optimizations

The current build process could be optimized in several ways:

1. **Caching**: Implement Turborepo's remote caching for faster builds
2. **Parallelization**: Ensure independent packages build in parallel
3. **Dependency Graph**: Optimize the dependency graph to minimize rebuild cascades
4. **Code Splitting**: Implement code splitting for better performance

## Environment-specific Configurations

The project doesn't currently have explicit environment-specific configurations. The implementation plan should include:

1. Development, staging, and production environment configurations
2. Environment variable management
3. Feature flag support

## Recommended Build Process Improvements

1. **Standardized Build**: Use consistent build tools across packages
2. **Watch Mode**: Implement efficient watch mode for development
3. **Incremental Builds**: Enable TypeScript's incremental builds
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Add bundle size analysis
5. **Build Reports**: Generate build reports for performance tracking

## Entry Point Structure

The planned structure will move entry points to the `apps/` directory:

- `apps/web-app`: Web application entry point
- `apps/mobile-app`: Mobile application entry point

This separation will allow:
- Platform-specific build configurations
- Cleaner dependency management
- Easier deployment pipeline setup
- Better separation of concerns

## Next Steps for Build System

1. Create proper entry points in `apps/` directory
2. Update build scripts to support the new structure
3. Configure environment-specific settings
4. Implement consistent build tools across packages
5. Set up proper CI/CD pipeline
